# NicePillz
this is a pillzmod pcb reworked to be dedicated to the nice!nano

Changes include:
- moved the register to the high frequency pins
- Terminal blocks for easy intall of the battery and power swtich
- moved col0 directly to the nice!nano so the keyboard can wake up by pressing the top ESC key.

## Thumb cluster
This is still ongoing. the 2 pcbs should be good, but they need to be merged. 

## ZMK
This is still a work in progress, as soon as I have a working pcb on hand the code will follow.
